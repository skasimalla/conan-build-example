#  Conan hello world example

This projest shows you how to build a conan project (just build, no packaging)

Build steps to follow: 

## Open a terminal using VSCode devcontainers
    ./build.sh

## How to use it
Read the build.sh it should pretty much explain everything

## Pre requisites

If you have never used devcontainers in VSCode, it's AMAZING, you can develop code on your machine without installing it's SDK as long as you have Docker on your machine. 

You need to have 
[VSCode ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer,
Docker on your computer, and the 
[Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) plugin installed on your VS Code.



brew install conan cmake
